# Hatstand

##Â Introduction
Hatstand is a fairly simple backpack viewer for TF2.  It uses information from the
steam apis (http://steamcommunity.com/dev) and then renders it.

Images are provided by Valve and are either from the api itself or the Team Fortress Wiki.

## Stuff I've used
* The charts are produced using the excellent Protovis library (http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/).
* Backend storage is provided by MongoHQ (via heroku) and the Mongoid library.

## Demo
A running instance is available at http://hatstand.heroku.com
